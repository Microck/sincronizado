---

Access your development sessions from anywhere using Agent-OS web UI or Kimaki Discord bot.

## Agent-OS web UI

Agent-OS provides a web UI to monitor and interact with OpenCode sessions running on your VPS.

### Setup

Agent-OS is installed by the VPS setup script (standard mode or higher). It runs as a systemd service on port 3000.

### Accessing Agent-OS

1. Via Tailscale (recommended)
   - Install Tailscale on your mobile device
   - Connect to your tailnet
   - Open `http://your-vps-hostname:3000`

2. Direct IP (if firewall allows)
   - Open `http://your-vps-ip:3000`
   - Only works if you are on same network or have port forwarding

3. Tailscale Funnel (external access)

```bash
tailscale funnel 3000
```

Creates a public HTTPS URL.

### Features

Session monitoring:

- View active OpenCode sessions
- See real-time AI output
- Monitor file sync status

Session control:

- Start new sessions
- Stop existing sessions
- Send commands to running sessions

Mobile-friendly:

- Responsive on phones/tablets
- Touch-friendly

## Kimaki Discord integration

Kimaki adds Discord-based control for your OpenCode sessions, including voice message support.

### Installation

Install Kimaki during VPS setup:

```bash
# via TUI
curl -fsSL https://sincronizado.micr.dev/install.sh | bash
# select Full, or enable Kimaki in Custom

# manual VPS setup
sudo ./scripts/setup-vps.sh --with-kimaki
```

### Setup

1. Create Discord bot

```bash
# on your VPS
npx kimaki
```

Wizard guides you through:

- Discord bot creation at discord.com/developers
- Required intents
- Invite link
- Stores config in `~/.kimaki/`

2. Start Kimaki service

```bash
sudo systemctl start kimaki
sudo systemctl enable kimaki
```

3. Invite bot to your server

- Use invite link from setup wizard
- Create a dedicated Discord server for dev
- Bot creates channels per project

### Usage

Text messages:

Send a message in a project channel to start an OpenCode session. Kimaki creates a thread and starts the agent.

Voice messages:

Record a voice message in Discord. Kimaki transcribes it (Gemini) and processes it as text.

Slash commands:

- `/session <prompt>` - start new session
- `/resume <session>` - resume previous session
- `/abort` - stop current session
- `/add-project <project>` - create channels for existing project
- `/queue <message>` - queue a follow-up message
- `/model` - change AI model for channel

File attachments:

Attach images/code/files to include them in session context.

### Architecture

Each Discord channel maps to a project directory on your VPS. Each Discord thread maps to an OpenCode session.

```
Discord Server
|- #project-a (maps to ~/projects/project-a)
|  `- Thread: "Fix auth bug" (OpenCode session)
|- #project-b (maps to ~/projects/project-b)
|  `- Thread: "Add tests" (OpenCode session)
`- #general (admin/commands)
```

### CI integration

Trigger Kimaki sessions from GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/investigate.yml
name: Investigate Issues
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  investigate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Start Kimaki Session
        env:
          KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          npx -y kimaki send \
            --channel "1234567890123456789" \
            --prompt "Investigate issue ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }}" \
            --name "Issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
```

### Multi-machine support

Run multiple Kimaki instances (one per VPS):

```bash
# VPS 1
data-dir: ~/.kimaki

# VPS 2
data-dir: ~/work-bot
```

Each has separate Discord bot + config.

## Security considerations

- Prefer Tailscale when possible (encrypted, private)
- Enable auth if exposing to internet
- Use strong VPS passwords or SSH keys
- Keep Agent-OS updated: `npm update -g agent-os`
- Kimaki permissions: only trusted users can trigger sessions
- Optional: create a "no-kimaki" role to block specific users

## Troubleshooting

### Agent-OS issues

Cannot connect:

1. Verify Agent-OS is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status agent-os
```

2. Check firewall allows port 3000:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

3. Verify Tailscale connection:

```bash
tailscale status
```

Agent-OS not starting:

1. Check logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u agent-os -f
```

2. Reinstall if needed:

```bash
sudo npm install -g agent-os
sudo systemctl restart agent-os
```

### Kimaki issues

Bot not responding:

1. Check Kimaki service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status kimaki
```

2. View logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u kimaki -f
```

3. Verify bot token is configured:

```bash
ls ~/.kimaki/
```

4. Restart Kimaki:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart kimaki
```

Voice messages not transcribing:

1. Ensure Gemini API key configured during `npx kimaki` setup
2. Check file size
3. Verify Kimaki has voice permissions in Discord channel

Slow performance on mobile:

1. Reduce sync scope in Mutagen (ignore big dirs)
2. Close unnecessary tabs
3. Use WiFi when possible
4. For Kimaki: Discord caches images, clear cache if needed

## Tips

Agent-OS:

- Bookmark the URL
- Add to home screen (app-like)
- Use split-screen on tablets

Kimaki:

- Use a dedicated Discord server for dev
- Use voice messages for hands-free workflows
- Send long prompts as file attachments (Discord limits)
- Use `/queue` to chain tasks
