description: Prepare your VPS for sinc sessions.
---

`sinc` needs a VPS it can SSH into and a place to run sessions.

## Requirements

- Linux VPS (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- SSH access (key-based recommended)
- `tmux` installed
- your AI agent installed on the VPS (`opencode` or `claude`)

## One-time setup

If you're using the setup wizard, it can run VPS setup for you.

```bash
sinc --setup
```

When prompted, choose **Run VPS setup script now**.

## Manual setup

SSH into your VPS and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microck/sincronizado.git
cd sincronizado
sudo ./scripts/setup-vps.sh
```

What it does:

- installs `tmux` (via apt/yum/dnf if available)
- creates the workspace directory used by `sinc`
- prints warnings if `opencode`/`claude` aren't installed

## Verify

On the VPS:

```bash
tmux -V
which opencode || true
which claude || true
```
