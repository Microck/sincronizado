Follow these steps to get a supercharged local-remote workflow.

## 1. Install & Setup

Run the installer. It will set up the binary, then run `sinc --setup` to configure your VPS, SSH keys, and sync.

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://sync.micr.dev/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://sync.micr.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then run:

```bash
sinc --setup
```

## 2. Connect

Navigate to any project on your machine and run `sinc`.

```bash
cd ~/my-projects/awesome-app
sinc
```

**What just happened?**
-   Created `~/workspace/awesome-app` on your VPS.
-   Synced your files instantly.
-   Connected via SSH.
-   Started an AI agent in a persistent tmux session.

## 3. Workflow

-   **Edit code locally**: use your favorite editor or tool on your own files.
-   **Run commands remotely**: `sinc` drops you into a remote shell where your agent is running.
-   **Detach**: press `Ctrl+B`, then `D`. The session stays alive.
-   **Resume**: type `sinc -r` later to pick up exactly where you left off.
