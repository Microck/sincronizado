Follow these steps to get a supercharged local-remote workflow.

## 1. Install & Setup

Run the installer. It will set up the binary and automatically launch the configuration wizard (connecting to VPS, SSH keys, etc).

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://sync.micr.dev/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://sync.micr.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

## 2. Connect

Navigate to any project on your machine and run `sinc`.

```bash
cd ~/my-projects/awesome-app
sinc
```

**What just happened?**
-   Created `~/workspace/awesome-app` on your VPS.
-   Synced your files instantly.
-   Connected via SSH.
-   Started an AI agent in a persistent tmux session.

## 4. Workflow

-   **Edit code locally** in VS Code / Cursor / Neovim.
-   **Run commands remotely** in the `sinc` terminal.
-   **Detach** with `Ctrl+B, D`. The session stays alive.
-   **Resume** later with `sinc -r`.
