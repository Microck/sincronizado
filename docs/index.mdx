description: keep files local. run remote.

**sincronizado** ("synchronized") lets you keep your files on your local machine while running heavy compute and agents on a vps.

## the problem

ai workflows are compute-heavy, but editing directly on a remote box is fragile. you either:

1.  burn local resources running agents and builds on your laptop, or
2.  move your workflow to a remote machine and lose the simplicity of local files.

## the solution

sincronizado gives you a local-files-first workflow:

- **local files**: you keep ownership of your project directory.
- **instant sync**: [mutagen](https://mutagen.io/) keeps the vps copy in sync.
- **persistent remote shell**: a `tmux` session on the vps keeps your agent and commands running even if you disconnect.

## how it works

when you run `sinc` inside a project folder:

1.  it creates/ensures a mutagen sync session for that folder.
2.  it sshs to the vps.
3.  it attaches you to a persistent `tmux` session for that project.

## is this for me?

| you will love sincronizado if... | you might not need it if... |
| :--- | :--- |
| you run agents/builds that strain your local machine. | everything you run locally is lightweight. |
| you want local-file ownership with remote compute. | you prefer a fully remote dev environment. |
| you want sessions that survive disconnects (tmux). | you don't need long-running remote processes. |
