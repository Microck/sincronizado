**sincronizado** ("synchronized") is the missing link for AI-native development. It allows you to use your favorite local tools (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, Neovim) while running your heavy AI agents and code execution on a powerful VPS.

## The Problem

AI development has a hardware problem:

1.  **Local is weak**: Running Claude Code, OpenCode, or other agents locally drains your battery, heats up your laptop, and consumes massive amounts of RAM.
2.  **Remote is laggy**: Coding directly on a VPS over SSH introduces typing latency. Remote development extensions (like VS Code Remote) are heavy and can disconnect when your internet blips.

## The Solution

Sincronizado gives you the best of both worlds:

-   **Zero-Latency Editing**: You edit files on your local machine. No SSH lag.
-   **Instant Sync**: [Mutagen](https://mutagen.io/) syncs your changes to the VPS in milliseconds.
-   **Persistent Execution**: Your AI agent runs in a remote `tmux` session. If you close your laptop, the agent keeps working.

## How it Works

When you run `sinc` in your project folder:

1.  **Syncs**: Creates a real-time, two-way sync session between your local folder and `~/workspace/<project>` on the VPS.
2.  **Connects**: SSHs into the VPS transparently.
3.  **Attaches**: Drops you into a persistent `tmux` session where your environment is ready.

## Is this for me?

| You will love Sincronizado if... | You might not need it if... |
| :--- | :--- |
| You use an AI agent (Claude, OpenCode) heavily. | You only write code manually. |
| You have a powerful desktop/VPS but want to code from a laptop. | You already have a perfect cloud dev environment (Codespaces/Gitpod). |
| You hate SSH latency when typing. | You are happy with VS Code Remote - SSH. |
| You want your agent to keep running when you go offline. | You don't need persistent background processes. |
